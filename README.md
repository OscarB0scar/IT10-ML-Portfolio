**Completed Portfolio Tasks**
1. GitHub Project Repo Setup (5 marks)
  - Completed in the setup of this Github repository
2. Supervised Learning - Linear Regression (5 marks)
  - This is a supervised machine learning algorithm for predicting  fish weight, given lengths, height, and width, using the linear regression technique. The goal of this program is to predict the weigth of a given fish, based on cross length, diagonal length, vertical length, diagonal length, height and width. Linear regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for predicting a continuous output variable based on one or more input features. It models the relationship between the inputs and the output as a linear equation, aiming to minimise the difference between the predicted values and the actual target values.
3. Supervised Learning - Classification using K-NN (5 marks)
  - This is a supervised machine learning algorithm for predicting the flower species of a flower, given petal and sepal lengths, using the K-NN Classification technique. The goal of this program is to predict the species of a given flower, based on sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification tasks, where an input is assigned to the class most common among its k nearest neighboring data points in the feature space. It relies on distance metrics to determine the similarity between data points and makes predictions based on the majority class within the k nearest neighbors.
4. Unsupervised Learning - Clustering (5 marks)
  - This is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm for predicting the digit of a handwritten mode, given a 64 bit image of a hand-written digit, using the K-Means Clustering technique. The goal of this program is to predict the digit of a given a matrix of pixel values. K-Means clustering is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm that groups similar data points into clusters by iteratively assigning them to the nearest cluster center and then recalculating the cluster centers based on the mean of the assigned points. It aims to partition data into distinct clusters based on their similarities, with each cluster centered around a mean point.
5. ML Essay (600 â€“ 750 words) - Uncovering Hidden Patterns: Exploring Unsupervised Learning in Software Engineering (10 marks)
  - Unsupervised learning is gaining momentum in the business world, where it's employed to analyse and group unlabelled datasets for better insights and more efficient software development. Alongside the emergence of AI products like OpenAI's ChatGPT, the integration of unsupervised learning holds promise for automating data analysis and elevating software development, all aimed at enhancing customer experiences. Software development's crucial role in modern businesses benefits from unsupervised learning's knack for error detection, code optimisation, and deciphering intricate data patterns. The projected surge of the AI software development sector, leaping from $20.6 billion in 2023 to an impressive $299.64 billion, highlights its substantial potential.
