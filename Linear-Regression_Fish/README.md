# Predicting fish weight using linear regression

Welcome to the linear regression project. This is a supervised machine learning algorithm for predicting  fish weight, given lengths, height, and width, using the linear regression technique. The goal of this program is to predict the weigth of a given fish, based on cross length, diagonal length, vertical length, diagonal length, height and width. 

## Description

In this algorithm we are using the fish market dataset from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aungpyaeap/fish-market). The dataset contains regarding 7 common market fish. Attributes include Species, Weight, Length1, Length2, Length3, Height and Width.

## Getting Started
### Executing program
The fish weight predictor uses Linear Regression to predict the weight of a fish based on the attributes, to predict the weight for a new datapoint:
* Species
* Weight
* Length1
* Length2
* Length3
* Height
* Width
1. **Library Imports**
  * pandas: Used for data manipulation and analysis
  * numpy : Numpy is the core library for scientific computing in Python. It is  used for working with arrays and matrices.
  * sklearn: tools for predictive data analysis
  * linear_model: Sklearn linear regression model
  * matplotlib: Itâ€™s plotting library, and we are going to use it for data       visualization
  * Pickle: the process of converting a Python object into a byte stream to store it in a file/database, maintain program state across sessions, or transport data over the network
  * style: styling the graph
3. **Loading Dataset** - The tool reads the csv file `Fish.csv`, and then filters a set of variables that are usable (integar or float values), so we will be excluding `Species`, and we well set the value of each datapoint to predict as `Weight `.
4. **Training the linear regression model** - The tool splits the data into training and testing variables, then creates a linear regression model using `linear_model.LinearRegression()`. The tool will take data from the highest accuracy model by itterating through this function 100 times. Linear regression works by drawing a line of best fit through a multi-dimensional field, and then predicting new datapoints using the line of best fit. 
5. **Displaying Predicted data vs Actual data** - The tool displays the predicted data and the actual data of the top trained model, the accuracy, intercept and the coefficients of the multi-dimensional line.
6. **Graphing Data** - While the machine learning model uses a multi-dimensional field to determine the linear prediction of a given set of data, we can sort of visualise how effective linear regression is on our data.
